GoogleVoiceNotify polls the Google Voice XML pages (http://posttopic.com/topic/google-voice-add-on-development), and sends notifications to any number of registered listeners.

At the moment, the Notifier only supports SMS notifications, but adding voicemail, missed calls, etc, is just a matter of writing scrapers for those as well.

Requires:
1. BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

I've also included a sample client for GoogleVoiceNotify that sends notifications to Prowl, which sends iPhone push notifications.

Usage:

from googlevoicenotify import GoogleVoiceNotify
gv = GoogleVoiceNotify('username', 'password')
gv.check()

Though you'll probably want to register at least one listener:

class PrintListener(object):
	def on_notification(self, event, name, message):
		print "(%s) %s said %s" % (event, name, message)

from googlevoicenotify import GoogleVoiceNotify
import time
print_listener = PrintListener()
gv = GoogleVoiceNotify('your_username', 'your_password', listeners=print_listener)
while True:
	gv.check()
	time.sleep(60)
